Hello!

My name is Lucas and I am 17 years old. I am a programmer and started my studies in 2020 at ETEC Ferrucio Humberto Gazzeta in Nova Odessa, SÃ£o Paulo. I fell in love with programming and continue to improve daily. I have experience in various technologies and can work as a full-stack developer, but Golang is my main language and I used to use it for back-end development. I am skilled in building REST APIs using microservices architecture, Google Protobuf and Golang. I also have experience in devops tasks including Bitbucket Pipelines, and some experience with Kubernetes and Gcloud, particularly Datastore. I also have knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Flutter and Dart.
